# Tic Tac Toe Solver

This work is devoted to God.

In the name of the highest good, it serves the highest good, to implement tree search to solve "Tic Tac Toe" optimally.

## Running

## "A" solver

First generate the solving tree:

```shell
python save_solving_tree.py
```

This needs to only be done once. It creates the "solving_tree.pickle" file.

Then run the solver with:

```shell
python solve.py
```

## Tree solver

```shell
python play.py
```

plays a game, choosing actions based on the solving tree.
